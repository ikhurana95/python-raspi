# Hacking Education at B6

This is the place where you can find more info about how to code in Python. Follow [our instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hackingeducation/) at @hackingEducation for regular updates or to get in touch if you have any questions.

## Take Home Exercises

The only way to learn is by doing! 1.5 hours a week is Not A Long Time to learn any new skill. It would be awesome if you had a look through some of these exercises and links. The more confident you are the more exciting sessions we can run (think AI, hacking).

1) [Exercises 1](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a76Un6bnMYSeZ28Bnk33rOfNYuacuHUw)

2) [Exercises 2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tkffouxa_kG3H2v80tEUWGNd2hm03LRR)

- [Mini Project 1 - Storyteller](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qjSi2-lcEbKYmsUCUMQBvcHWePgxrwSF)

- [Mini Project 2 - Interest Calculator](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SlEELT5xSyQZN9iyt8P8-ukwpBjREFdk)

If something doesn't make sense or you get stuck, try googling to see if you can find answers. (For example if you get a error message, try googling the error message. Chances are you are not the first person to have this problem, and the answer is probably somewhere online).  If that doesn't work and you are still stuck, send us an email or message on Insta.

### How to Run These Exercises

The exercises are [Colab Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/). These work just like the Jupyer notebooks we have running on the Rasberry Pi's in the workshops, except instead of running on the Pi, they run on a computer somewhere in Google's cloud, and interact with it over the internet!

0) Make sure you are signed into a Google account in your browser first! 

1) Clicking on the above links will take you to a page like the one you can see in the screenshot below. Clicking "OPEN IN PLAYGROUND" will take you to a copy of the Colab notebook that you will be able to edit

2) You can save the notebook to your Google drive, which means any changes you make will be saved so you can come back to it later!

3) The first time you run something, you will get a warning. Just untick the box and press run, and you will be good to go!

## Learning to Learn

Here are some more resource to get you started learning independently.

### Videos

Videos are a great way to learn. There are loads! [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=introduxction+to+python) for some ideas. Anything with a decent number of views is probably a safe bet, but just find someone who is engaging for you.


### Interactive

If you want something more interactive
1) [Interactive, free course (w3schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp). A great reference to save and come back to.
1) [Free Python 2 Course (Codecademy)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python). Everything runs in the browser, there is automatic marking too, so you know if you are doing things right! (Python 2 is a little old now though :( )
2) [An introduction to Python in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ondrolexa/r-python/blob/master/01-Introduction-to-Python.ipynb) (Not written by us).


### More...

The ultimate guide is Google. Let's say I don't understand for loops. [Googling something relevant](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+do+for+loops+work+in+python) will take me to a bunch of places I can find out more. Good site to look out for in the search results are:
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [Offical Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- https://wiki.python.org/moin/ForLoop
