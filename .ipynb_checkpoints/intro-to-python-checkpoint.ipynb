    "This page you're currently on is called a _Jupyter Notebook_. It's an _interactive Python_ environment, which allows us to experiment with and learn Python in an _interactive_ way. In general _Jupyter_ is what we'd call an _Integrated development environment_ (IDE), a program that enables us to write and run Python programs. There are many different IDEs for any single programming language, with different kinds of advantages for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is quite different other IDEs because it allows us to both write text and code, in the same document. The basic building block of a Jupyter notebook is the _cell_. Code is written in _code cells_ and text is written in _markdown cells_. This, for example, is a text cell. If you try double clicking on the cell, the cell should change into _edit mode_, and you'll be able to edit this text! To go back to displaying the cell normally, press _SHIFT+ENTER_.\n",
