Your program should ask the user how much they wish to deposit in the first year, at what interest rate and then should calculate the savings after the first year. The interest should compound annually.\n","2. It should then ask how much the user wishes to deposit in the second year, add this on to the first year saving and calculate interest after the second year. \n","3. Structure the program in a while loop so that it repeats step 2 for further years until the user enters “0” to stop.\n","\n","If you don’t know what compound interest is, <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/interest-tutorial/compound-interest-tutorial/v/introduction-to-compound-interest\">here</a> is a helpful video from Kahn academy:\n","\n","Here’s an example of what the output of the program could look like:\n","\n","    What interest rate? 1.05\n","    How much would you like to deposit? 100\n","    You know have £105.0 in the bank.\n","\n","    How much would you like to deposit? 50\n","    You know have £162.75 in the bank.\n","\n","    How much would you like to deposit? 200\n","    You know have £380.8875 in the bank.\n","\n","    How much would you like to deposit? 75\n","    You know have £478.681875 in the bank.\n","\n","    How much would you like to deposit? 65\n","    You know have £570.86596875 in the bank.\n","\n","    How much would you like to deposit? 220\n","    You know have £830.409267188 in the bank.\n","\n","    How much would you like to deposit? 600\n","    You know have £1501.92973055 in the bank.\n","\n","    How much would you like to deposit? 0\n","    \n","---\n","\n","\n","Topics that you should know before attempting this mini-project:\n","\n","- Arithmetic operations (+, -, /, etc.)\n","- Integers and floating points\n","- Variables\n","- Asking for user input (the `input` function)\n","- The `while`-loop\n","\n","If you are unsure about some of these topics, don't let that stop you!
